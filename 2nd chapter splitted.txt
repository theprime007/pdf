(a) Viscosity	(b) Surface tension
(c) Upward thrust	(d) Pressure
RRB ALP CBT II Physics & Maths 22 .01.2019 Shift III
Ans. (c) :
Upward thrust is defined as the force that is exerted on an object by the fluid when the object is submerged. It is also called as buoyant force. It always acts upwards. It always acts against the weight of an object.
Fbuoyant = ? × g × V
Where, ? = density of fluid
g = acceleration due to gravity V = volume of fluid
In gravity free space,
Fbuoyant = 0
That is upward thrust will not exist in a gravity free space.



Viscosity : The property of a fluid which opposes the relative motion between the layer is called viscosity.
Surface tension : It is a property of liquids characterized by the surface molecules tendency to shrink into a lower surface area as a result of bulk force from inner molecules.

surface tension =

force length

Pressure : Fluid pressure is a measurement of the force
per unit area on an object in the fluid or on the surface of a closed container.
* Viscosity, surface tension and pressure does not depends on the gravity.
